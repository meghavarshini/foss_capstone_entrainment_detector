### FOSS CONCEPTS AND A PROBLEM THAT I LEARNT HOW TO SOLVE
1. Open Science and reproducibility- I want to share code for users to better understand my paper, and replicate my work to get the same results I got
  2. Solution- provide well documented code and clearly describe how someone can go about doing this.
  3. FOSS sessions- [add numbers] 

### STEPS for this week
3.  Make sure all directory names have local paths
4.  Add instructions for installing required softwate
  1. OpenSMILE
  2. Sph2pipe
  3. Fisher Corpus
  4. Pre-trained model
5. Provide instructions for `setup.py`/ `requirements.py`
6. Provide an entry point for the code
7. Instructions for downloading the ASIST3 dataset from its location on the server
8. Descriptions files of every directory
